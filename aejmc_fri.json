These attacks can feel particularly existential and exhausting for academics of historically marginalized identities, and those who mentor students from those groups. This panel includes faculty from a range of geographies who research, teach, and have the lived experience of the identities and concepts under fire. We draw from research on how communities have produced media as a form of mutual support and celebration in challenging times, and share our own experiences with finding purpose, joy, and solidarity as forms of resistance. We'll acknowledge the vulnerabilities of tenure-track and contingent faculty, as well as of graduate students and/or non-U.S. citizens, in the current environment, as well as the roles of family structure/caretaking responsibilities, geography, financial resources, and mental/physical health on our capacities to do our work while finding balance and wellness in the today's climate in higher education.",

As sport continues to be a central platform for social discourse, it is essential that communication strategies in sport branding, promotion, journalism, and broadcasting recognize and address issues of diversity. Panelists will discuss innovative approaches to integrating issues of race, gender, and representation into sport communication and leadership curricula, ensuring students are equipped with the cultural competence necessary for current and future industry roles. Topics will include strategies for fostering inclusivity in sports journalism, challenges in promoting diverse voices in sports media, the role of sport branding in shaping societal perceptions, and the opportunities inherent in internal communication and leadership roles in sport organizations. This discussion will provide insights for educators, administrators, internship coordinators, and student media production advisors; addressing how to create more inclusive and equitable spaces in sport communication, both in classrooms and in the professional field.",

The panel will explore how PR was initially used as a tool of control and influence by colonial administrations to manage their image, communicate policies, and suppress dissent. It will then shift focus to the post-colonial era, examining how newly independent African nations adapted and reshaped PR to fit the needs of their diverse, rapidly evolving societies. This discussion will cover key shifts, including the use of PR to support economic development, governmental transparency, and civil society engagement in a digitalized world. By comparing these two eras, the panel seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of how PR practices in Africa have evolved in response to changing political, social, and economic landscapes.",

Examined much less frequently is the question of why some WOC leaders leave their roles. In this panel, trail-blazing WOC leaders in public relations will offer candid insights into their varied experiences and offer advice on leaving leadership for those who are considering or already executing these challenging roles.",

This panel presents results from our baseline survey, a study conducted among N=1,510 young adolescents in Florida. Among the survey's key findings were that kids who have their own smartphone fared better than children who don't on nearly every measure of wellness we assessed, such as reduced likelihood to report depression and anxiety symptoms, feeling better about oneself, and spending more time in-person with friends. We did find, though, that publicly posting online was positively associated with reporting depression and anxiety symptoms and with sleep deprivation. This panel will discuss many of these findings, as well as results related to news consumption among children.",

It will explore how advertisers can ethically collect and utilize data without compromising consumer trust, fostering long-term business success. Holistic personalization (that is, delivering a personalized experience to customers that spans the entire customer journey) is the gold standard of advertising. While people want personalized experiences, there's a delicate balance between providing value and creating distrust. Panelists will discuss the importance of customer trust in data-driven advertising and explore how to design ethical data strategies that promote transparency and build trust with consumers.",

Panelists will present their research on these topic areas and engage in dialogue about how all of these outlets are pushing against mainstream news industry norms. Via language, content and guiding principles, digital minority news outlets are approaching news production and audience engagement in novel ways. This panel will highlight how using a community-centered approach changes the editorial decision-making process for minority media journalists. Also, the digital format enables a type of engagement that varies from when print was the dominant media format. These outlets' use of social media creates unique ways to practice two-way communication with readers and listeners and connote in-group authenticity. By discussing how digital minority media journalists and consumers are conceptualizing these outlets in the new media age, this panel will provide useful insights for scholars interested in digital media, race, and journalism.",

Edelman's representative will discuss how the firm advises and strategizes with clients to 1) prepare for mis/disinformation targeting their organization, 2) manage mis/disinformation when it implicates their organization, and 3) educate an organization's publics in identifying false information before it becomes a problem.",
