It aims to (1) help educators efficiently integrate Al into curricula, (2) prepare students for Al-driven advertising careers, and (3) address ethical issues like student over-reliance on Al and biases in Al-generated content. Panelists will introduce key Al technologies (e.g., ChatGPT, predictive analytics, Al-powered media planning, and visualization tools) and show how they enhance brainstorming, prototype creation, and data-driven refinements. They'll share case studies of successful classroom integrations and provide a live demonstration of Al-powered creative generation. Ethical considerations such as plagiarism, Al bias, and responsible usage will also be discussed.",
