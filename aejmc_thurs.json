As major companies like Meta and Google dominate the media landscape, the boundary between business management and media management scholarship has become increasingly blurred. The panelists will explore whether media management occupies a specialized niche within broader management studies or stands as a unique field in its own right. They will also examine the future of media management and address its practical implications for educators and researchers interested in the area.",

Proprietary data, differing publication priorities, and skepticism about \"outdated\" or \"unrealistic\" studies further hinder collaboration.

It fosters community building by highlighting the role of fan communities in advocating for social justice, thereby creating a sense of belonging and collective action among diverse groups. The abundance of fan cultural products opens the door for representation and identity-building, yet it also impacts the understanding and acceptance of different cultures, becoming a pivotal element to generate dialogue and foster more diverse online and offline communities.",
