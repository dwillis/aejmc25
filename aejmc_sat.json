Culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP) is a theoretical and methodological perspective that seeks to improve student achievement by recognizing and building on students' cultural contributions in teaching and learning practices. It helps students to affirm cultural identity while developing critical perspectives that challenge inequities in our society (Ladson-Billing, 1995). This panel reunites projects of diverse journalism educators working in minority-serving institutions and or with international students. They will analyze the teaching and learning practices that include written, visual and multimedia outcomes. Panelists will reflect on their own strategies while teaching journalism, including bilingualism teaching and learning practices.",

However, many barriers, both physical and invisible, continue to impede the full participation of underrepresented groups, particularly within marginalized communities. This session will explore these invisible barriers and propose strategies for creating more inclusive academic spaces. Geographical challenges also persist, as many academic institutions are in areas that, while not overtly hostile, may not be hospitable to diverse communities. These environments can create an unwelcoming atmosphere that adds an additional layer of difficulty for underrepresented faculty and students. In summation, this session aims to shed light on these issues, discuss potential solutions, and share practical strategies for making academia more accessible and inclusive for scholars of all backgrounds. By addressing these invisible barriers, we hope to inspire a deeper commitment to equity across the academic landscape.",

    "description": "AEJMC's 2025 First Amendment Award will honor former Western Washington University student journalists Erasmus Baxter, Asia Fields and Julia Furukawa as well as the many current student journalists fearlessly covering their campuses and their communities during challenging times. As students at Western Washington, Baxter, Fields and Furukawa took the extraordinary step of suing their own institution for withholding public records related to sexual misconduct cases. Their years-long legal battle resulted in a landmark court ruling affirming the public's right to access these records and a $111,780 settlement from the university in 2024. While this award traditionally honors seasoned journalists, AEJMC's Professional Freedom & Responsibility Committee recognizes these exceptional early-career individuals for demonstrating unwavering commitment to First Amendment principles from the very beginning of their professional journeys. Their tenacity illustrates the crucial role so many student journalists play in holding powerful institutions to account. The First Amendment Award, created in 2006, recognizes individuals or organizations who demonstrate strong commitment to freedom of the press and who practice or support courageous journalism. Previous recipients include Errin Haines and the Staff of The 19th (2024); Margaret Sullivan, The Guardian (2023); Steven Waldman of Report for America (2022); Omar Jimenez of CNN (2021); Shane Bauer of Mother Jones (2020); Nikole Hannah-Jones of the New York Times Magazine (2019); Ronan Farrow of the New Yorker and Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey of the New York Times (2018); The Pulitzer Prizes (2017); Reporters Without Borders (2016); Floyd Abrams (2015); Joel Simon of the Committee to Protect Journalists (2014); the First Amendment Center (2013); Carole Simpson (2012); Michael Kirk of Frontline (2011); Nat Hentoff (2010); Seymour Hersh of the New Yorker (2009); Clarence Page of the Chicago Tribune (2008); Helen Thomas of UPI and Hearst (2007); and Molly Ivins (2006).",
